# Libft
The purpose of this project was to create our own library by implementing various utility functions from scratch, replacing the use of the C standard library. We were encouraged to add our own functions to this library as we progressed with our studies.
## Lessons Learned

- Basics of C programming
- Basics of Makefile
- How libraries work and are created
- String manipulation
- Memory managment
- handling I/O
